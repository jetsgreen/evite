                    Where our story began… from Maria’s point of view haha
                </p>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    One day I decided to organize a Paintball outing for close friends and family, which happen to
                    include
                    Paula & Jonathan (my aunt & her husband). We were supposed to leave at 7 o’clock, but Paula wouldn’t
                    be
                    her if she wasn’t running late . As I grew tired of waiting for her, I rushed into her home ready
                    to
                    cause a scene but as soon as I charged through the door I stopped to see an unknown man sitting
                    casually
                    on the sofa. This man stood up and politely introduced himself. His name was Felix – Hello Felix.
                    Who
                    was he? Where did he come from and why haven’t I met him before!? All questions were running through
                    my
                    mind and I made sure to quiz Paula – forget about her running late.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">

                    We finally were on our way to battle the apocalyptic zombies and everyone was pretty excited. While
                    we
                    were there I accidently misfired and shot Paula in the neck, which took our outing from 100 to 0
                    REAL
                    quick – oops . We all retreated back to Paula & Jonathan’s house for pizza, wine, & American Horror
                    Story, Season 4 – if you know me, you KNOW, this is one of my favorite shows. A night in with good
                    vibes, wine, and the mysterious Felix sounded good to me! That night ended with talks about the show
                    &
                    me giving Felix directions back home haha.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    I admit, I wanted to get to know him more but I thought – “alright, I’ll see him when I see him”.
                    Low
                    and behold, guess who had a DM the very next day. At first, I was a bit hesitant to open it because
                    I
                    didn’t know who Felior21 was but that was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. He learned the
                    night
                    before about my fear of clowns and he thought it’d be amusing to say “BOO!” with a picture of
                    Pennywise
                    the Clown, from IT as his very first message to me. I replied with a “I hate you -_- and I didn’t
                    ask
                    for help with my phobia of clowns”. I probably should’ve ended the statement with an LOL but I
                    wouldn’t
                    be me if I wasn’t a little spicy. ;)
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">
                    The rest was history – I still remember our first date. It was at Euro’s Café with a BYOB menu and
                    we
                    shared a hookah. From that moment on, I knew something was different about him – something more to
                    explore, something exciting.

                    Almost 6 years later and we’ve been inseparable, we’ve created love, memories, and a beautiful
                    family.

                    The day has come for us to finally become one. I couldn’t be happier to spend the rest of my life
                    with
                    my best friend.
